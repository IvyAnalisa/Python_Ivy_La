    "# <h4>3.3 Implementing vaccination </h4>\r\n",
    "<p>It turns out the community has experienced viruses before and once it becomes a known problem in the community villagers start vaccinating against it. Each person only needs one dose to reach full immunity, however worth of note is that being fully vaccinated does not count as having recovered from the disease. Awareness about the virus usually become apparent once it reaches about 15-25% of the population (we will thus go with the idea that once 20% of the population have been/become sick vaccination starts). For simplicity sake we say that 4% of the population which are neither sick, dead nor already vaccinated each day gets vaccinated once the process is started, meaning that the doctors cant really tell if someone has already recovered but they obviously can tell if someone already has become vaccinated. Lets save some lives! </p>\r\n",
    "<h5>Instructions</h5>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<p>Do like this (All of the following is done in the Person class): </p>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<ul>\r\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">In the constructor create a new variable self.vaccinated and set it to False</li>\r\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Modify the if statement in infect_others to include a check that the person about to be infected is not already vaccinated. There should now be 4 conditions in the if statement in total. That is all we need to do for the Person class, lets proceed to the village class!</li>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "</ul>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<p>Next up the village class (All of the following is done in the Village class) </p>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<ul>\r\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Create three variables in the constructor. self.init_vaccination which you set to 0.2*init_population_size which corresponds to when vaccination will start, a second variable called self.vaccination_started which you set to False and the third being daily_vaccination_threshold which is set to 0.04*init_population size</li>\r\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">In the advance_days method replicate how we did with the people_recovered, people_sick and people_dead variables but with a new variable called people_vaccinated. The people_vaccinated variable should increment if person.vaccinated == True. Add the people_vaccinated variable to the return statement at the end of the method. Remeber to add the variable in the start_simulation method just as with the others! This allows us to track how many are vaccinated if we wish.</li>\r\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Create a new method called vaccinate_population and for now just type pass inside of it as a placerholder. After the forloop in advance_days write an if statement checking if people_sick >= self.init_vaccination and self.vaccination_started == False, if both these conditions are met change the value of self.vaccination_started to True and add a print statement saying something alike \"At the end of the day {amount of people sick} have become sick and a vaccination process has been initiated!\". Just after this if statement add another if statement where you check if self.vaccination_started == True, if so call the vaccinate_population method. Make sure the print in the first if statement only runs once, otherwise you have some bug in your code.</li>\r\n",
    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">In the vaccinate_population method first create a variable called people_vaccinated_today which you set to zero. Then write a forloop that goes through the population with a loop variable person which represents each individual like we do in advance days. In the forloop write an if-statement checking whether people_vaccinated_today is equal to the daily_vaccination_threshold, if so break the forloop (using the keyword break) since we have reached maximum amount of people being vaccinated daily. Else if (write an elif statement) check whether that the person we are currently examining from the population is susceptible (i.e is not sick, is not dead and is not already vaccinated). If the conditions are met set that persons vaccination status to true and then increment the people_vaccinated_today variable by one. </li>\r\n",

    "<p>You are now good to go and have implemented vaccination into the village! Awesome! Rerun the code a couple of times and you should see that sometimes the vaccinations does not start and sometimes it does. Whenever vaccination is introduced a lot fewer people become sick (for me it is usually almost about half the amount of people).
